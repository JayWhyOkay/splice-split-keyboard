# Splice - A Split Alice

*Splice* is a split keyboard in the Alice layout. 

The goal is to design a board suited for myself as there are no boards designed quite like the Alice. Most split boards are generally based on an ortholinear layout, something that I personally canntot get used to. 

The keyboard is based off [the Sofle Keyboard from Josef](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard), with adjustments made to fit the preferred layout. 

Notes: Revision 1 and 2 PCB uses CFTKB and Sofle footprints, and all credits for footprints used belong to the respective footprint designer.
